## Alex Squires - Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Bath

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the department of chemistry at the university of Bath. My work focuses on looking at battery materials, specifically their defect and non-stoichiometric properties. I intend for this page to function as a broad overview of what I do, and also to help me organise my thoughts, semi-publically, so that should anyone stumble across this page, they can call me out on anything I'm claiming.
