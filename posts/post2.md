## Anionic Redox in Cathode materials

Beyond the solid state electrolytes that I mentioned, the other key component of a battery that stands to make gains in its component materials is the cathode. I'd like to split this discussion in to two parts; first, an accessible discussion around these materials, followed by a much less accessible discussion of the science behind some of the new direction in the field. 

### Battery Cathodes

A cathode is one of the two electrodes that are seperated by our electroylte. It is this cathode that is one of the major limiting factors in advances in battery materials, and therefore a subject of a great deal of the research in the field. While the battery is discharging, lithium ions arrive at the cathode from our other electrode (the anode) via the electrolyte. Separatley, electrons have gone round the external circuit to power whatever device our battery is hooked up to. The lithium and electrons meet at the cathode and wait until the process is reveresed on discharge. The capacity of the cell is determined by how much Li each electrode can hold, as this will in turn determine how many electrons are released through the circuit. I assume if you've made it this far through this post, you will be aware of the fact electron flow is electricity. Therefore, in simple terms, the more Li your electrodes can store, the more electricity your battery can release.
