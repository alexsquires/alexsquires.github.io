## Alex Squires - Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Bath

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the department of chemistry at the university of Bath. My work focuses on looking at battery materials, specifically their defect and non-stoichiometric properties. I intend for this page to function as a broad overview of what I do, and also to help me organise my thoughts, semi-publically, so that should anyone stumble across this page, they can call me out on anything I'm claiming. 

Also included will be my usage of code (primarially Python) in the hopes that on exposing it to the world, it will encourage me to follow better practice and develop my skills
