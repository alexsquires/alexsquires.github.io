I am often asked what it is that I do. I quickly then try and steer the conversation to a close by saying that I'm a Ph.D. student researching battery materials. What I would love would be an explanation that I could direct errant family members and friends to explaining exactly what that means. 

I'm not enough of a sociopath to actually cite this blog post when in conversation, but thought that it would be a good exercise to attempt to explain my work in an interesting, succinct, and accessible manner.

My working involves looking at the nature of the materials that comprise a rechargeable lithium ion battery, the type you would find in your phone, or laptop. A battery has 3 key components (for my purposes at least): two electrodes, and a medium between them through which lithium ions can move, an electrolyte. So far, the work of my Ph.D. has revolved around looking at the properties of materials that could potentially act as battery electrolytes. Current technologies use flammable electrolytes. This has been seen by consumers in a number of cases, I have cited one of the more high-profile examples below. 

We use these flammable electrolytes because they are the best of a bad bunch. One way to avoid these battery fires would be to replace the flammable electrolyte with a ceramic. This is a wonderful idea in theory, and is possible. The reason why we donâ€™t see such batteries all over is that lithium transport through a solid electrolyte is a slow process. It is a process that needs to become faster in order for these solid batteries to become competitive with more conventional technology.

What has this got to do with me? There is an electrolyte material called lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) which shows promise as a fast, solid-state lithium conductor. Last year (2017) an interesting observation was made about this material, in that not only was it conducting lithium, it was also conducting oxygen vacancies - a lack of oxygen.* It is important to establish why it is these oxygen vacancies occur, and what the theoretical basis is for them. Using computers (a lot of them) it is possible to calculate whether we should expect this process to occur. 

One key reason for wanting to determine this is that if we do see such oxygen vacancies, and they are mobile in through the structure of our ceramic electrolyte, they must be accounted for when we look at the conductivity of LLZO. There are also more nuanced reasons to be interested in them, but that is likely for a different, and more involved discussion.
